# Air Quality Data Analysis

## General info
This project focuses on the analysis of air quality data, with a specific emphasis on detecting outliers. The goal is to identify any anomalies or unusual patterns in the data that could provide insights into air quality issues. The outliers detection was made with two methods: Tukey's method (IQR) and Isolation Forest algorithm.

### Dataset
The data used in this project was obtained from the UCI 'Air Quality Data Set. It includes hourly measurements of various air quality parameters, such as PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, for a specific location over a 6-month period. It can be find [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality#).

## Technologies
